# MaxNeoSpritePro
It seemed like I couldn't find anyone that had made a file for this so I had to try ;)
I am running a Creality Ender 3 Max Neo, on a Creality Touchpad, with a Sprite Extruder Pro. I kept my filiment senesor.
I could only set the bed mesh size to 260 * 250 due to the increased size of the print head and the diffrent BL touch 
location.
